# Notable results from experiments

train / test split - 140 / 50 = total 190 subjects

these are validation results

all are 7 fold stratified CV (train / val split - 120 / 20)

fixed random state 42

## Standard ML

- KNN
  - 71 += 6 %
  - 3 neighbors

- Naive Bayes
  - 79 += 9 %

- Random Forest
  - 80 += 10 %

- SVC
  - 85 += 10 %
  - low polynomial kernels
  - 4 folds get 95 % accuracy, 3 get 70 - 75 % accuracy.

- Elastic Net al√° logistic regression
  - 87 += 8 %
  - folds are not strictly weak or strong
  - usually, a weak one, one or two middle and then strong

Reported results are for full 8100 flattened matrix. Results for upper triangle matrix are equivalent. Further taking absolute value decreases accuracy by ~3 % and std by ~1-2 %.

## Fully connected network

Tested all three correlation types.
  - Pearson: best
  - Spearman: comparable
  - Partial Pearson: uninformative

Tested all three matrix flattening types.
  - Full: comparable
    - 90 * 90 = 8100
  - Upper triangle: best
    - 90 ** 2 / 2 - 45 = 4005
  - Absolute upper triangle: on most folds looses accuracy around 7 %

- id: 002
  - mean: 85 %
  - std: 5 %
  - ~80k parameters
  - 8 hidden nodes
- id: 003
  - mean: 84 %
  - std: 7 %
  - ~150k parameters
  - 16 hidden nodes

- the concat layer is not necessary, input to the last linear layer can be simply the output of preceding layer without decrease in accuracy
